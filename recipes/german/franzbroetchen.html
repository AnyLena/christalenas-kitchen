    <div class="p-2">
        <ul>
          <li>Crumble ½ cube of yeast into a tall container & pour in 275 milliliters of lukewarm milk. Next, stir everything together with a whisk or fork until the yeast has completely dissolved.</li>
          <hr>
          <li>Then place the yeast-milk mixture together with 500 grams of flour, 100 grams of soft butter, 75 grams of sugar, 1 sachet of vanilla sugar & a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl & knead into a smooth dough for 4 - 5 minutes using a food processor or a mixer with dough hooks.</li>
          <hr>
          <li>Then shape the dough into a ball, place back in the mixing bowl & leave to rest covered with a kitchen towel for 30 - 45 minutes until the dough has visibly increased in volume.</li>
          <hr>
          <li>Mix 125 grams of brown sugar with 1 heaped tablespoon of cinnamon & set aside. Line 2 baking trays with baking paper. After the resting time, place the dough on a lightly floured work surface & roll out with a rolling pin as thinly and rectangularly as possible to a size of 50cm x 40cm.</li>
          <hr>
          <li>Brush the rolled out dough with 100 grams of soft butter, then sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon & sugar mixture & roll up tightly from the long side. Cut the dough roll with a knife diagonally offset or trapezoidally into 12 rolls of approximately the same size.</li>
          <hr>
          <li>To achieve the typical look, press the middle of each roll with a wooden spoon handle so that the cut surfaces to the left & right of the handle bulge slightly upwards. Place the finished buns on the 2 prepared baking trays with plenty of space between them & leave to rest covered with a kitchen towel for a further 30 - 45 minutes.</li>
          <hr>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (top/bottom heat) in good time & bake the French rolls for 15 - 20 minutes after the resting time until golden brown.</li>
        </ul>
